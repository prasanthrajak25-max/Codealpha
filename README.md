Project Title :cyber security
Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer
Objective: Develop a Python-based network sniffer that captures and analyzes network packets.

Tools Used: scapy, socket

Key Features:

Captures live network traffic.

Extracts and displays packet details: source/destination IPs, protocols, ports, and payloads.

Helps understand how data flows through the network and packet structure.

Learning Outcome: Gained foundational knowledge of packet-level communication, TCP/IP stack, and Python networking libraries.

üéØ Task 2: Phishing Awareness Training
Objective: Create a presentation/module to educate users about phishing attacks and online threats.

Key Elements:

Explained types of phishing (email, website, SMS, voice).

Taught how to identify fake emails and URLs.

Included best practices and tips to avoid phishing.

Added real-world examples and interactive quizzes for user engagement.

Learning Outcome: Developed awareness training material suitable for corporate or educational use; enhanced understanding of social engineering tactics.

üõ†Ô∏è Task 3: Secure Coding Review
Objective: Audit code for security flaws and propose improvements.

Steps Taken:

Selected a sample application (e.g., in Python or JavaScript).

Conducted a manual and/or tool-assisted static analysis.

Identified common issues like SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded credentials, etc.

Suggested remediation and secure coding practices.

Learning Outcome: Improved understanding of software vulnerabilities and secure software development lifecycle (SDLC).
